## Job Market Paper
***"Spatial Knowledge Spillovers in R&D and Aggregate Productivity: Evidence from the Reunification of Germany"*** \
*Abstract:* The spatial concentration of R&D is crucial for aggregate productivity due to spatial knowledge spillovers. In this paper I provide evidence on spatial knowledge spillovers in R&D. I causally estimate these spillovers by isolating quasi-exogenous variation from the arrival of East German inventors across West German clusters during the Reunification of Germany in 1990. I then build a quantitative spatial model of innovation where the quality of tradable goods is determined by inventors' innovations, which in turn are subject to spatial knowledge spillovers. I estimate the model using a novel administrative matched dataset from German inventors between 1980 and 2014. I use the model to quantify the productivity gains from the reduction of migration costs for inventors, and the implementation of R&D subsidies.
