## Job Market Paper
***"Spatial Knowledge Spillovers in R&D and Aggregate Productivity: Evidence from the Reunification of Germany"*** \
*Abstract:* Abstract I quantify the importance of spatial knowledge spillovers in Research and Development (R&D) for aggregate productivity. Using a new administrative dataset from German inventors, I causally estimate these spillovers by isolating quasi-exogenous variation from the arrival of East German inventors across West Germany after the Reunification of Germany in 1990. Doubling the number of inventors in a location leads to average inventor productivity gains of 40.9%. I then embed these estimated spillovers into a quantitative spatial model of innovation, and use it to quantify the productivity gains from implementing policies that promote R&D activities. A 25% reduction of migration costs for inventors and the 25% subsidy for firms' R&D expenditures in the 2020 German R&D Tax Allowance Act increase aggregate productivity by 5.87% and 4.27% respectively. Finally, these productivity gains increase with the degree of spatial knowledge spillovers in R&D.
