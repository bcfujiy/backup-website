## Job Market Paper
***["Spatial Knowledge Spillovers in R&D and Aggregate Productivity: Evidence from the Reunification of Germany"](https://bcfujiy.github.io/img/papers/CF_SpilloversRD.pdf)*** \
*Abstract:* I causally estimate spatial knowledge spillovers in Research and Development (R&D) and quantify their importance for R&D policies. Using a new administrative panel on German inventors, I estimate these spillovers by isolating quasi-exogenous variation from the arrival of East German inventors across West Germany after the Reunification of Germany in 1990. I find that increasing the number of inventors working in a technological cluster by 10% leads to average inventor productivity gains of 4.09%. I then embed the estimated spillovers into a spatial model of innovation, and use it to quantify the productivity gains from implementing policies that promote R&D activities. The model predicts that reducing migration costs for inventors by 25% increases aggregate productivity by 5.87%, and the 25% subsidy for firms' R&D expenditure within the 2020 German R&D Tax Allowance Act would increase aggregate productivity by 4.27%. Finally, the productivity gains from these policies increase with the level of spatial knowledge spillovers in R&D.
